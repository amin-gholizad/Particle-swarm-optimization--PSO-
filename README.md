# Particle swarm optimization (PSO)
Particle swarm optimization algorithm ([PSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization)) for a minimization problem. In this project, nonlinear constraints are implemented as infeasible solutions.
This project is implemented in C++17.
Constraints and objective in one function.

# Features

1. Template class for particles with number of variables as the template parameter is used to initialize the arrays of the needed size.
2. Template function for pso with number of variables and swarm size is as the template parameters is used to initialize arrays accordingly
3. The cost function should accept one array as input and output a pair of doubles representing cost and constraint of the problem respectively.
4. The Mutation is used to avoid local minima.
